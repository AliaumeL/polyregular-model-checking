abstract: |
  We reduce the model checking problem for a subset of Python
  to
  the satisfiability of a first-order formula over finite words,
  which is known to be decidable. The reduction is based on the theory
  of polyregular functions, a recently developed generalization of
  regular languages to polynomial output string-to-string
  functions.
  We implemented this reduction in a verification tool called PolyCheck, 
  that can use
  both automata-based solvers and 
  classical SMT solvers as backends.
