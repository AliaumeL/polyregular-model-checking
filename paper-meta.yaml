abstract: |
  We introduce a high-level language with Python-like syntax 
  for string-to-string, polyregular, first-order definable transductions.
  This language features function calls, boolean variables, and nested
  for-loops. We devise and implement a complete decision procedure for
  the verification of such programs against a first-order specification.
  The decision procedure reduces the verification problem to the decidable first-order
  theory of finite words (extensively studied in automata theory), which we discharge 
  using either complete tools specific to this theory (MONA),
  or to general-purpose SMT solvers (Z3, CVC5).
