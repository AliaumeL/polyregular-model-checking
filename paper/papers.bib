  Why3 clearly separates the purely logical

  Why3 comes with a new enhanced language of
  logical specification. It features a rich library of
  proof task transformations that can be chained to produce a suitable
  input for a large set of theorem provers, including SMT solvers,
  TPTP provers, as well as interactive proof assistants.}
