\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\paragraph{Motivation.} Verification is important. And it is hard. People have
tried to make it easier. We are focusing on programs that do not use the full
power of Turing machine and this is not absurd:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Configuration management
    \item Simple string rewriting programs
    \item "Extract transform load" pipelines
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Contributions.} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduced a high level language that is close to Python and 
        suitable for model checking.
    \item Our language is modular and contains functions, enabling for a clear
        and concise implementation.
    \item Effectively proved equivalence of the high-level language with an existing
        model (polyregular functions), building a conversion algorithm.
    \item Implemented a model checking algorithm for polyregular functions,
        by reducing it to the satisfiability of a first-order formula on finite words.
    \item We tested our program on examples using different backends to solve
        the resulting formulas (CVC4, Z3, Alt-Ergo and Mona), showing
        their complementarity.
\end{itemize}

\AP The crucial property of \kl{high-level language} it hat it has decidable 
\intro{model checking problem}: given a function $f \colon X \to \Bools$,
we can decide whether there exists $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = \btrue$.
