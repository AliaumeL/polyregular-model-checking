\section{Polyregular Functions}
\label{sec:polyregular}

To obtain a decision procedure for the verification of \kl{Hoare triples} for
\kl{for-programs}, we will 
prove that they can be compiled to \intro{first-order polyregular functions} -- 
a class of transductions introduced in \cite{bojanczyk2018polyregular} whose model checking 
problem is decidable \cite[Theorem~1.7]{bojanczyk2018polyregular}. 
We provide two equivalent definitions of the \kl{first-order
polyregular functions}: one using \kl{first-order simple for-programs} \cite[p.
19]{bojanczyk2018polyregular} and one using the logical model of
\kl{first-order string-to-string interpretations} \cite[Definition
4]{bojanczyk2019string}, the equivalence of which 
was proven in
\cite{bojanczyk2018polyregular}.

To make the models more suitable for large alphabets (such as the Unicode
characters), we present them in a symbolic setting (which uses a simplified
version of the ideas presented in \cite{d2017power} or in
\cite[Section~3.1]{bojanczyk2023growth}). This will dramatically reduce the
size of the \kl{first-order string-to-string interpretations}, and in turn, of
the \kl{first-order formula} that we will feed to the solvers. We will prove in
\cref{sec:low-level} that every \kl{first-order simple for-programs} can be
transformed into a \kl{first-order string-to-string interpretation} in the
symbolic setting. We believe that the other inclusion should also hold,
but do not prove it, as it is out of this paper's scope.


\subsection{Symbolic transductions}

\AP
Consider the program in \cref{fig:swapAsToBs}, which swaps all \texttt{a}s to
\texttt{b}s in a string. Even though it operates on the entire Unicode
alphabet, it only distinguishes between three types of characters: \texttt{a},
\texttt{b} and the rest.
To formalize this observation, we model the Unicode alphabet as an infinite set $\mathcal{D}$, and
we define a function $T : \mathcal{D}^* \to \mathcal{D}^*$ to be
\intro{supported by} a set $A \subseteq \mathcal{D}$, if for every function $f:
\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}$ that does not \intro{touch} elements of $A$ (i.e.
$\forall_{a\in A}, f^{-1}(a) = \{a\}$), it holds that:
\begin{equation*}
    \forall_{w} \quad T(f^*(w)) = f^*(T(w)) \quad ,
\end{equation*}
Where $f^*$ is the extension of $f$ to $\mathcal{D}^*$, defined by applying $f$
to every letter.

    \label{fig:swapAsToBs}
\end{wrapfigure}

Functions defined by
\kl{for-programs} (of type $\TOut[1] \to \TOut[1]$)
are supported by the finite set $A$ of letter constants that they use.
This is also going to be the case for the \kl{simple for-programs}
that we introduce in \cref{subsec:simple-for-programs}.
In
\cref{subsec:fo-string-to-string}, we will define a version of the
\kl{first-order string-to-string interpretations} in a way that only depends on
the size of their support $A$, and not on the number of the Unicode characters.

\subsection{First-Order Simple For-Programs}
\label{subsec:simple-for-programs}

\AP \intro{First-order simple for-programs}
 ---  originally introduced in \cite[p.
19]{bojanczyk2018polyregular} ---
can be seen as
simplified\footnote{Actually, the \kl{for-programs} were designed as an
extended version \kl{first-order simple for-programs}.} 
version of the \kl{for-programs}. The main difference is that the \kl{simple
for-programs} only define transductions of type $\TOut[1] \to \TOut[1]$. Here
is an example in a Python syntax:

\input{figs/reverse_words_simple.tex}

We disallow constructing intermediate word-values, there are no variables of
type $\TOut[n]$ for any $n$, and it is not possible to define functions (other
than the main function). As a consequence, the
for-loops can only iterate over the positions of the input word as in
\circleref{1}{sfp:for1} and \circleref{2}{sfp:for2}.
The character at a given position can be accessed using the keyword $\mathsf{label}$, 
whether when testing it (\circleref{5}{sfp:labelTest}) or when printing it in
(\circleref{6}{sfp:labelPrint}).
As we are considering a restriction of \kl{for-programs}, we only allow comparing labels
to constant characters (\ref{item:equality-checks}).
Finally, we only allow introducing boolean
variables at the top of the program (\circleref{1}{sfp:boolDeclTop}) or at the
beginning of a for loop (\circleref{3}{sfp:boolDeclFor}). 

\subsection{First-Order String-To-String Transductions}
\label{subsec:fo-string-to-string}
\AP \kl{First-order string-to-string interpretations} forms an other model 
that defines functions $\mathcal{D}^* \to \mathcal{D}^*$. 
It is based on the \intro{first-order logic on words} ($\intro*\FO$),
the syntax of which we 
recall in \cref{fig:fo-syntax}.
To evaluate such a formula $\varphi$ on a word $w \in \mathcal{D}^*$ we perform the quantifications
over the positions in $w$. The predicates $x = y$ and $x < y$ have the natural 
meaning, and $x =_L \mathtt{a}$ is checks if the $x$-th letter of $w$ is equal to $\mathtt{a}$.
Let us recall that the \intro{quantifier rank} of a formula
is the maximal number of nested quantifications in it.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{align*}
        \varphi,\ \psi :=&~ \forall_x\; \varphi ~|~ \exists_x\; \varphi ~|~ \varphi \wedge \psi ~|~ \varphi \vee \psi ~|~ \neg \varphi \\
                |&~ x = y ~|~ x < y ~|~ x =_L \mathtt{a} \textrm{, where } \mathtt{a} \in \mathcal{D}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{First-order logic on words.}
    \label{fig:fo-syntax}
\end{figure}

\AP An important property of $\FO$, is that it has decidable \intro{emptiness},
i.e. given a formula $\varphi$, one can decide if there is a word $w$ such that
$\varphi$ holds for $w$. For finite alphabets, this property is well-know
\cite{buchi1960weak}, and for the infinite alphabet $\mathcal{D}$ it is the
consequence of the finite-alphabet case (\cref{lem:fo-emptiness}).

Having discussed the \kl{first-order logic on words}, we are now ready to
define the \kl{first-order string-to-string interpretations}.
\begin{definition}
A \intro{first-order string-to-string interpretation} consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A finite set of \intro{character constants} $A \subset_{\textrm{fin}}\mathcal{D}$.
\item A finite set $T$ of \intro(transduction){tags}.
\item An \intro{arity function} $\mathsf{ar} : T \to \Nat$.
\item An \intro{output function} $\mathsf{out} : T \to A + \{1, \ldots, \mathsf{ar}(t)\}$. 
\item A \intro{domain formula} $\varphi_{\mathsf{dom}}^t(x_1,\ldots,x_{\mathsf{ar}(t)})$ 
    for every tag $t \in T$.
\item An \intro{order formula} $\varphi_{\leq}^{t,t'}(x_1,\ldots,x_{\mathsf{ar}(t)},y_1,\ldots,y_{\mathsf{ar}(t')})$ for every $t,t' \in T$. 
\end{enumerate}
The \kl(formula){order} and \kl(formula){domain} formulas should only use constants from $A$.
\end{definition}
\noindent
The interpretation's output for a word $w \in \mathcal{D}^*$ is obtained as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Take the set $P = \{1, \ldots, |w|\}$ of the positions in $w$, and construct the set 
           of \emph{elements} as the set $T(P) = (t : T) \times P^{\mathsf{ar}(t)}$
           of all tags from $T$ equipped with position tuples of the appropriate arity.
    \item Filter out the elements that do not satisfy the domain formula.
    \item Sort the remaining elements according to the order formula. Typically, we 
          want the order formula to define a total order on the remaining elements of $T(P)$ -- 
          if this is not the case, the interpretation returns an empty word.
    \item Assign a letter to each element according to the output function: For an 
          element $t(p_1, \ldots, p_k)$, we look at of $\text{out}(t)$: If it returns $a \in A$
          the output letter is $a$. If it returns $i \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$, we copy the output letter from the
          $p_i$-th position of the input.
          
\end{enumerate}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
\[
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $\text{out}(\mathtt{printB}) = \mathtt{b}$ & \ \ \ & $\text{out}(\mathtt{copy}) = 1$ \\
\end{tabular}
\]
\[
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $\varphi_{\text{dom}}^{\mathtt{printB}}(x) : x =_L \mathtt{b}$ & \ \ \  &$\varphi_{\text{dom}}^{\mathtt{copy}}(x) : x \neq_L \mathtt{b}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\]
\[ 
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
    $\varphi_{\leq}$ & $\mathtt{printB}(x_1)$ & $\mathtt{copy}(x_1)$ \\
    \hline
    $\mathtt{printB}(x_2)$ & $x_1 \leq x_2$ & $x_1 < x_2$ \\
    $\mathtt{copy}(x_2)$ & $x_1 \leq x_2$ & $x_1 \leq x_2$ \\
\end{tabular}
\]
\caption{The \texttt{swapAsToBs} interpretation.}
\label{fig:swapAsToBsInterpretation}
\end{wrapfigure}
For example, let us present a \kl{first-order word-to-word interpretation} for
the function \texttt{swapAsToBs}
in \cref{fig:swapAsToBsInterpretation}. It has two tags \texttt{printB} and
\texttt{copy}, both of arity~$1$. The element $\mathtt{printB}(x)$ outputs the
letter \texttt{b} and $\mathtt{copy}(x)$ outputs the letter of $x$-th position
of the input word.
The element $\mathtt{printB}(x)$ is present in the output if $x$ is labelled with the letter \texttt{b}
in the input, otherwise the element $\mathtt{copy}(x)$ is present:
The tags are sorted by their positions, with ties resolved in favour of \texttt{printB}.


\subsection{Hoare Triple Verification}
\label{sec:pullback}

\AP
We say that the Hoare triple $\{ \varphi \}\; F\; \{ \psi \}$ is valid if
for every word $w$ that satisfies $\varphi$, the output $F(w)$ satisfies
$\psi$. An important property \kl{first-order string-to-string interpretations}
is that they admit a direct reduction of the \intro{first-order Hoare triple}
verification problem to the \kl{emptiness problem} for the \kl{first-order
logic on words} \cite[Theorem~1.7]{bojanczyk2018polyregular}. However,
the resulting construction is not efficient.
We provide a direct construction of a first-order formula $\chi(\phi, F, \psi)$
that is \kl{unsatisfiable} if and only if the triple $\{ \phi \}\; F\; \{ \psi \}$ is valid.
Moreover, the size and the \kl{quantifier rank} of $\chi$ are bounded by the following low-degree polynomials:
\begin{align*}
    \qrank(\chi) \leq \max\left(\qrank(\phi),\ \qrank(\psi) \cdot \left(\textsf{ar}(F) + 1\right)  + \qrank(F)\right) \quad |\chi| = \mathcal{O} (|\phi| + |F| \cdot |\psi|)
\end{align*}

Here $|F|$ denotes the sum of the sizes of formulas in $F$,
$\qrank(F)$ denotes quantifier depth of the deepest formula in $F$, 
and $\textsf{ar}(F)$ denotes the maximal arity of the tags in $F$.


To construct the formula $\chi$, we introduce a \intro{pullback operator}
$\pi(F, \psi)$ that transforms the formula $\psi$ applied to the output $F$, to
a formula $\pi(F, \psi)$ that can be applied directly the input word,
corresponding to a form of \emph{weakest precondition} \cite[Chapter
7]{WINSKEL93}. The pull-back operation is defined in such a way that $F(w)$
satisfies $\psi$ if and only if $w$ satisfies $\pi(F, \psi)$. Once we have the
pull-back operation, we can define $\chi(\phi, F, \psi)$ as $\phi \wedge \neg
\pi(F, \psi)$. In the rest of this section, we show how to efficiently
construct $\pi(F, \psi)$.

\paragraph{Naïve Pullback Definition.} Let us start 
with a simple but inefficient construction of the \kl{pullback operation}.
Every position from $F(w)$ corresponds to a tag $t$ and a tuple of $\mathsf{ar}(t)$ positions of the input word $w$, 
so we can replace each quantification in $\psi$ with a conjunction or disjunction
over the tags,
and use respectively the \kl{order formula}
and \kl{output function} to implement the
predicates over positions of $F(w)$.
For example: 
\[ 
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $\forall_{x}, \psi$ & $\quad \rightsquigarrow \quad$ & $\bigwedge_{t_x \in T} \forall_{x_1, \ldots, x_{\mathsf{ar}(t)}} \left( \varphi_{\mathsf{dom}}^t(x_1, \ldots, x_{\mathsf{ar}(t)}) \Rightarrow \psi'_{t} \right)$
\end{tabular}
\]
A similar transformation can be done for the existential
quantifications. Then, one can
implement the $\leq$ predicate by consulting the \kl{order formula}:
\[
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $x \leq y$ & $\quad \rightsquigarrow \quad$ & $\psi_{\leq}^{t_x, t_y}(x_1, \ldots, x_{\mathsf{ar}(t_x)}, y_1, \ldots, y_{\mathsf{ar}(t_y)})$
\end{tabular}
\]
Similarly the $=_L$ predicate can be handled by consulting the \kl{output function}, and
$x = y$ predicate can be handled by comparing equality of the \kl(transduction){tags}
and the positions of $x$ and $y$. This construction, although correct, is unfortunately inefficient:  Replacing each quantification with a disjunction or conjunction
over tags, results in an exponential blow-up of the formula. 

\paragraph{Efficient Pullback Definition.} Let us introduce an additional
finite sort $T$ to the logic, which allows us to quantify over the \kl(transduction){tags} using
$\forall_{t \in T} \varphi$ and $\exists_{t \in T} \varphi$. This does not add
expressive power to the logic, as the new quantifiers can be replaced by a
finite conjunction (resp. disjunction) that goes through the tags. However,
this new sort will allow us to construct the \kl{pullback operator} in a more
efficient way, that can be understood by the solvers (we discuss it in more
details at the end of this section). With the new sort of \kl(transduction){tags}, we can
pull back the quantifiers in the following way: 
\[ 
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
   $ \pi(F, \forall_{x} \psi)$ & $\quad = \quad$ & $\forall_{t_x \in T} \; \forall_{x_1, \ldots, x_{\mathsf{ar}(F)}} \left( {\mathsf{dom}}(t_x, x_1, \ldots, x_{\mathsf{ar}(F)}) \Rightarrow \pi(F, \psi)\right)$
\end{tabular}
\]
Where $\mathsf{dom}$ is the following predicate based on 
the \kl{domain formula}:
\begin{align*}
    \mathsf{dom}(t, x_1, \ldots, x_{\mathsf{ar}(t)}) :=&~ \bigvee_{t' \in T} \left( t = t' \wedge \varphi_{\mathsf{dom}}^{t'}(x_1, \ldots, x_{\mathsf{ar}(t')}) \right)
\end{align*}
In order to implement the atomic predicates,
we use  formulas similar to $\mathsf{dom}$, but based the \kl{order formula} and \kl{output function}:
\begin{align*}
   \pi(F, x \leq y)  =&~ \bigvee_{t_1, t_2 \in T} \left( t_x = t_1 \wedge t_y = t_2 \wedge \varphi_{\leq}^{t_1, t_2}(x_1, \ldots, x_{\mathsf{ar}(t_1)}, y_1, \ldots, y_{\mathsf{ar}(t_2)}) \right) \\
   \pi(F, x =_L \mathtt{a}) =&~ \left(\bigvee_{t \in T \wedge \mathsf{out}(t) = \mathtt{a}} t = t_x\right) \vee
\left(\bigvee_{t \in T \wedge \mathsf{out}(t) \not \in A} (t = t_x \wedge x_{\mathtt{out}(t)} =_L \mathtt{a})\right)
\end{align*}
This way, we push the disjunction over \kl(transduction){tags} all the way down in the formula,
thus avoiding the exponential blow-up of the naïve approach.

\paragraph{Encoding tags.} Finally, let us briefly discuss how we handle the
tags in the formulas fed to solvers. For the SMT-solvers, we use the
\texttt{smtlib v2.6} format with logic set to \texttt{UFDTLIA}
\cite{BARRETT17}, which allows us to add finite sorts and quantify over them.
For the MONA solver, which only supports the sort of positions, we encode the
tags as the first $|T|$ positions of the input word.
