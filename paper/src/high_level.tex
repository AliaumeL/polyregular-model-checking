\section{High Level For Programs}
\label{sec:high_level}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain that we want to consider list-manipulating functions
          that only exhibit polynomial growth.
    \item Introduce the syntax
    \item Give an example of a high level for program
    \item Give an operational / denotational semantics
    \item Explain the typing system
    \item Illustrate the type system with an example + counter-example for polynomial growth
\end{itemize}
