In this section, we provide a compilation from high level to low level For
programs. In order to do so, we introduce a new constructon to the language,
that are \emph{generator expressions}, representing the evaluation of a
function on a given input. Namely, we add $\ogen{s}$ to the syntax of
expressions, where $s \in \hlstmt$, and has type $\TOut[n]$ for some $n$.
Similarly, we add $\bgen{s}$ to the syntax of boolean expressions, where $s \in
\hlstmt$ and has type $\TBool$. Note that the semantics of these expressions
should be carefully defined as follows: evaluating $\ogen{s}$ should be
equivalent to evaluating $s$ in the current context \emph{hiding all boolean
variables}. Because of the non-shadowing property of the language, and because
boolean variables are the only ones that can be mutated, this ensures that
evaluating $\ogen{s}$ multiple times will always yield the same result in a
given context. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{item:lit_eq_elim} Elimination of Literal Equalities,
        i.e., of 
        expressions $\bliteq{c}{o}$ where $c \in \cexpr$
        and $o \in \oexpr$.
    \item \label{item:fun_elim} Elimination of Function Calls.
        A function call will be replaced by a custom \kl{generator expression}
        which is essentially a closure.
    \item \label{item:lit_elim} Elimination of Literals Production,
        i.e., of constant expressions in the construction of $\oexpr$
        except for single characters.
    \item \label{item:bool_elim} Elimination of Boolean Generators.
    \item \label{item:let_output_elim} Elimination of Let Output Statements
    \item \label{item:return_elim} Elimination of Return Statements
    \item \label{item:for_loop_exp} Expansion of For Loops
    \item \label{item:let_bools_top} Defining booleans at the beginning of for loops
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}
    These rewriting step terminates, preserve the semantics of the program,
    and 
    a program of type $\TOut[1] \to \TOut[1]$ that is
    fully normalized possesses the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It only iterates over its input or the reverse of its input
        \item All introduced variables are boolean and introduced at the top level
            or at the beginning of a for loop.
        \item There are no return statements, and the only
            yield are of type character and contain either a constant
            or a variable.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

Now, it is clear that this sub-language of for-programs corresponds
to the simple-for-programs described in the previous section, hence
we have effectively obtained the following corollary:

\begin{corollary}
    Every \kl{high level program} of type $\TOut[1] \to \TOut[1]$
    is (effectively) computable by a \kl{simple for-program}.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
    Every \kl{high level program} has \kl{polynomial growth},
    and the \kl{model checking problem} is decidable for 
    \kl{high level programs}.
\end{corollary}

\AP
The elimination of function calls (\cref{item:fun_elim}) is done by replacing
every function call by a \emph{generator expression}, which is essentially 
including the body of the function at the call site. This is possible
because
\begin{lemma}
    For every \kl{high level function} $\hlfundef{f}{x_1, \dots, x_n}{s}$,
    for every arguments $a_1, \dots, a_n \in \aexpr$,
    for every \kl{evaluation environment} $\rho$,
    \begin{equation*}
        \semO{ f (a_1, \dots, a_n) }{\rho}
        = 
        \semO{ \ogen{ s[a_1/x_1, \dots, a_n/x_n] } }{\rho}
        \quad .
    \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}

\AP The elimination of literal equalities (\cref{item:lit_eq_elim}) 
follows from \cref{lem:constequality}.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:constequality}
    For every
    constant expression $c \in \cexpr$ of type $\TOut[n]$, there exists a \kl{high
    level function} $f_c$ of type $(\TOut[n], 0) \to \TBool$ such that
    $\semB{f_c(o)}{\rho} = \semB{\bliteq{c}{o}}{\rho}$ for every $o \in \oexpr$ and
    \kl{evaluation environment} $\rho$. Such functions are defined by induction on
    $c$, using a simple pattern matching.
\end{lemma}

\AP
The eliminations of the $\hlletoutput{x}{e}{s}$ statements (\cref{item:let_output_elim})
follows from the fact that 
$\semS{\hlletoutput{x}{e}{s}}{\rho} = \semS{s}{\rho[x \mapsto \semO{e}{\rho}]}
= \semS{s[x \mapsto e]}{\rho}$ for every \kl{evaluation environment}.

\AP The elimination of return statements (\cref{item:return_elim})
is done by replacing every return
statement by a yield statement, and introducing a boolean variable
\texttt{has\_returned} that is used to prevent further outputs after the first
return statement is reached.
