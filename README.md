# Polyregular Functions and Model Checking

> Model checking (star-free) polyregular functions written in a Python-like
  syntax by translating them to first order logic.

The repository is divided in two main parts: first the implementation of the
prototype model checker (in Rust), and the sources of the associated research
paper (in LaTeX). Examples of code written in Python and their corresponding
first-order logic specification are provided in the `examples` directory.

## Requirements

You will need a working Rust environment to compile the model checker. To
compile the paper, it suffices to have a working LaTeX distribution and the
`make` tool, but to make modifications it may be useful to have
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) installed.
